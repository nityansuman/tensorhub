## You have just found TensorHub

The open source library to help you develop and train models, easy and fast as never before with `TensorFlow 2.0`.
`TensorHub` is a global hub of `building blocks` and `ready to serve models`.

`TensorHub` is a library of deep learning models and neural lego blocks designed to make deep learning more accessible and accelerate ML research.

Use `TensorHub` if you need a deep learning library that:
+ **Reproducibility** - Reproduce the results of existing pre-training models (such as Google BERT, XLNet).

+ **Model modularity** - TensorHub is divided into multiple components: ready-to-serve models, layers, neural-blocks etc. Ample modules are implemented in each component. Clear and robust interface allows users to combine modules with as few restrictions as possible.

+ **Fast** - Our custom utilities and layers are made from the ground up to support pre-existing standard frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras with efficiency in mind.

+ **Prototyping** - Code less build more. Apply `TensorHub` to create fast prototypes with the help of pre-cooked models, custom layers and utilities support.

+ **Platform Independent** - Supports both `Keras` and `TensorFlow 2.0`. Run your model on CPU, single GPU or using a distributed training strategy.

## Getting started: 30 seconds to TensorHub

Building a question answering system, an image classification model, a Neural Turing Machine, or any other model is just as fast.
The ideas behind deep learning are simple, so why should their implementation be painful?

For a more in-depth tutorial, you can check out:

+ [Getting started with Image Classification using TH](https://github.com/nityansuman/tensorhub/tree/master/examples/)
+ [Build your own custom Model with TF2.0 and TH](https://github.com/nityansuman/tensorhub/tree/master/examples/)

Look here [examples folder](https://github.com/nityansuman/tensorhub/tree/master/examples) for more.

## Installation

Before installing `TensorHub`, please install its backend engines: TensorFlow (*TensorFlow 2.0 is Recommended*).

+ [Install TensorFlow and Get Started!](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)

+ [Build, deploy, and experiment easily with TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You may also consider installing the following **optional dependencies**:

+ [cuDNN](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/) (*Recommended if you plan on running Keras on GPU*).
+ HDF5 and [h5py](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/build.html) (*Required if you plan on saving Keras models to disk*).

Then, you can install TensorHub itself.

```sh
$ pip install tensorhub
```

## Support
